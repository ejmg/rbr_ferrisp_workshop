* =Ferrisp= Workshop Step =Err=
  Hi there! Thanks for checking out the workshop materials for =Ferrisp=, a simple and rusty LISP
  implementation. If you haven't already, you really ought to checkout the [[file:README.org][README.org]] file first
  which will better explain what is going on here!

  This file is a placeholder for the actual requirement files that will accompany each module. After
  checking out the =README=, checkout a tagged version and come back here!
